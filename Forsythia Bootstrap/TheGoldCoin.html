				<h1>The Gold Coin</h1>
				<br>
				<p>There was once a rich man who always carried in his pocket a gold coin. The gold coin went everywhere with the man. It saw the man spend many of his other gold coins from his fat purse and the gold coin wished it could be just like the other coins and go out into the world. One day when the rich man went to the market, the gold coin decided it wanted to see the world, so it leapt out of the rich man’s pocket and fell to the ground with a hard thunk.</p>
<p>The gold coin was barely on the ground long enough to collect dust when it was again picked up. “At last,” it thought, “I shall see what it is like to be spent.” But it was picked up by a merchant and tossed into a chest with many other gold coins. There it sat for many long months. It began to think it would sit and do nothing for its entire life. But one day the chest was opened and the merchant pulled out one, two, three gold coins and the gold coin was the third. It was so excited. “At last,” it thought, “now I shall see what it is like to be spent.” But the coin wasn’t spent. It was given to a farmer who had delivered his crop to the merchant to be sold.</p>
<p>Slightly disappointed, the coin thought, “Well, farmers are poor folks, surely he will not keep me locked up in a box.” The coin watched his new owner curiously as he went about the market. The farmer suddenly stopped. The coin looked around to see why. There by the edge of the market was a woman pleading for money for her and her small child. The people of the market passed by, some avoiding the woman, others kicking dirt at her. She was thin and pale. Her child clung to her with wide frightened eyes. The market was coming to a close and the woman went away empty handed.</p>
<p>The coin was surprised when the farmer followed her, careful to remain unseen. She clung to her stomach in hunger, and fatigue made her hold the wall for support. She and her child entered a small dwelling and closed the door. The coin looked up at the farmer and saw tears in his eyes. He looked down at the three gold coins in his hand, picked up the gold coin, wrapped it in a bit of cloth, and left it on the doorstep. The gold coin was baffled. Why would the poor farmer leave him on the doorstep? Surely the farmer needed the gold coin badly. He only had two coins left now. Would that be enough for him and his family? Surely the farmer needed the gold coin. The gold coin watched through the fabric as the farmer knocked on the door and ran away.</p>
<p>The door opened to the pale woman. She looked down and carefully picked up the fabric bundle and unwrapped it. The gold coin was shocked when the woman fell to the ground weeping. Tears fell on the coin, then she clutched it to her heart and she rocked back and forth weeping, weeping. The gold coin didn’t understand what was happening, but it suddenly felt as if it was worth more than a prized coin of a rich man, or part of a horde of a merchant. It even felt worth more than a means to a farmer. It felt its worth was more than all of these combined. It would save a woman and child from starvation, death. The woman spent the coin and it was able to give the woman and child so much, they had enough food for months. The coin never saw the woman again and after that it was spent many times over, but it never forgot the sacrifice of the farmer nor the tears of the woman.</p>
