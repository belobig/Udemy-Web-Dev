				<h1>The Adventures of Blanket Dog</h1>
				<br><p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">This story begins with a very small dog. His name is Poquito and he is very cold.</p><br>
	<p>One cold afternoon, Poquito lay shivering on the floor, when from out of nowhere, a warm blanket descended on top of him. He looked around to thank whoever gave him the blanket, but no one was there. He wondered at the mystery of it, but it was so nice and warm that he just closed his eyes and fell asleep.</p>
	<p>When he woke up, it was morning. He felt so good and rested; it was the best sleep he had had since he was a puppy. He got up, stretched, and got out of the blanket.  But the cold air hit him and he started to shiver, so he went back under the blanket.</p>
	<p>“I can’t stay in here all day.” he said. So he came up with an idea. He tied the blanket around his neck and it was just the right size. It didn’t even drag on the floor.  Satisfied that it would stay on, he nodded his head, making his large, pointy ears wiggle, and he headed to the kitchen to make himself some breakfast. After he ate, he decided to go for a walk.</p>
	<p>With the blanket still around him, he went to the park. The park was a very popular place in the town where Poquito lived. The town was called Houndville.</p>
	<p>As he was walking, he started to hear other dogs giggling as he walked past. He turned to see what they were laughing at, but as soon as he turned, they would look away and stop laughing. Poquito shrugged and kept walking through the park when one of the big dogs came and stood in front of him so he couldn’t get by.</p>
	<p>“Well, if it isn’t Poquito, the puny Chihuahua. I wouldn’t have expected to see you out on a cold day like today, but what’s this? I see, you decided to wear your bed.  What a brilliant idea.” the big dog said. Other dogs around started to snicker and guffaw. </p>
	<p>“Husky, you’re as large as ever,” said Poquito, “but I have something I have to do right now, so I will be on my way.”</p>
	<p>“Don’t be a spoil-sport. I was merely admiring your new addition. That blanket just goes so well with your enormous ears.” One dog couldn’t hold it in and started to laugh so hard, he was rolling around on the ground. Poquito blushed.</p>
	<p>“This is a very fine blanket and there is nothing wrong with my ears. I will be going now.”</p>
	<p>Husky stepped in front of Poquito again and got down in his face. “Not so fast, the fun has just begun.” He started to reach for Poquito’s blanket, but Poquito hurried and zipped through his legs. By the time Husky realized where he went, Poquito was out of the park and safely made his way to his home again. But Husky’s last words were ringing in his ears; they were, “Blanket Dweller!” He thought very seriously about tossing the blanket out, but it was a good blanket and it didn’t do anything wrong. So he curled up under the blanket and he felt warm and safe, so he didn’t throw it away and he fell asleep with a smile on his face.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">~*~</p>
	<p>Poquito never went anywhere without the blanket and many of the dogs called him ‘Blanket Dweller’ instead of Poquito. But Poquito didn’t mind what they said about him anymore. The mysterious blanket had kept him warm, so he wore it like a second skin. But he began to notice strange things happening. For instance, one day he went to the dog bone store and he found the perfect one which happened to be just out of reach.  He looked at it longingly. It really was the perfect bone, but he didn’t want to ask a bigger dog to help him get it. They always seemed to make fun of his size when he did ask them. So he decided to try jumping to get it. He jumped once, but he was still too short, so this time he really concentrated. Then he jumped. But instead of getting the bone he had aimed for, he suddenly hit the ceiling and rebounded back to the floor. He quickly looked around to see if someone had seen, but no one was around. He sat on the ground and asked himself what had just happened. “I just hit the ceiling. How did I do that?”  While he thought, he looked at the bone. “I think I can get it this time.” This time he jumped carefully and he got his bone. He proudly took it to the front and paid for it. He didn’t know what was happening, but whatever it was, it was sure paying off.</p>
	<p>Over the next week, Poquito secretly tried to find out what else he could do. He knew he could jump really high and he found that he could swim really good and run as fast as the wind. At night, when he was laying under the blanket with his nose sticking out, he would think, “How am I able to do this? Me! I’m such a little dog.” Then he would sigh and go to sleep. But this time, when he woke up, he jumped up. “The blanket!” he barked. “Of course, that has to be it!  This blanket must be giving me these special powers.” Now he discovered this none too soon, for that very next day, a terrible thing occurred.</p>
	<p>Poquito was out for his daily walk when suddenly, he could hear what sounded like the whole of Houndville barking in panic. Poquito ran to see what was going on. He found an alarming commotion just outside of Town Hall. In front was the Mayor, Great Dane, and he was being held hostage by the biggest cats Poquito had ever seen. One huge cat that was holding Mayor Great Dane yelled, “Silence, you dogs, if you want your Mayor to live. We want only one thing from all of you. You all must become our slaves.”  The gathering of dogs all howled and barked, some angry, some scared, others worried.</p>
	<p>“You have a choice. Either you become our slaves willingly, or we will have to force you!” the cat hissed. No one moved. Husky, who happened to be next to Poquito, was shaking when he asked Poquito what he thought.</p>
	<p>“I think we could never bow down to such evil cats. They need to be stopped.”</p>
	<p>Husky laughed, “And who is going to stop them, you? Those cats must weigh at least two hundred pounds each!” He shook his head.</p>
	<p>“Well, what is your answer?” the big cat yelled.  No one in the crowd said anything.</p>
	<p>The big cat turned to the other cats and said, “You heard them, go get ‘em, boys!”  With that, the huge cats dove into the crowd, catching all the dogs they could and throwing them into big nets. All the rest of the dogs ran in panic, but Poquito stood his ground.</p>
<p>Husky turned and yelled, “Aren’t you going to run?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m going to stop them.” With that, Poquito took off. Husky’s jaw dropped as he watched Poquito run as fast as the wind. Poquito got some rope and he zipped around the cats, tying them up before they could realize what was happening. He finished tying up the last one, then stopped in front of the leader cat.</p>
<p>“Well, it seems we have a little hero dog here.” The cat tossed the Mayor aside and got into a fighting stance. “And by little, I mean miniscule.”</p>
<p>Poquito and the cat began to move in a circle. They eyed each other, then Poquito dashed around the cat and caught the cat by its tail, making it yowl in surprise. Poquito didn’t see the cat turn in time and he jumped out of the way as the cat swiped at him, scratching one of his legs with its claws. Poquito yipped and gave his wound a quick lick. This cat was smarter than the others. It would be much harder to catch and defeat this kitty.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere Poquito heard something odd. Looking around, he saw that he and the huge cat were surrounded by a large circle of dogs and they all started to yell, “Go, Blanket Dog! You can do it!”  Poquito felt so charged by their words that he really felt like he could defeat this huge cat.</p>
<p>“Do you think I, The Great Cat Master could be defeated by you?  You’re more rat than dog to me.” he said, and flexed his long sharp claws.</p>
<p>Poquito saw that the cat looked a little worried though, so he began his attack. Faster than ever before, he was running and jumping around the cat, making punches and kicks until the confused cat was spinning in circles. Finally, Poquito flew through the air and all four of his paws hit the cat for a final blow to the cat’s head, and down the cat went with a mighty thud hitting the ground, unconscious.</p>
<p>Then, all the dogs cheered, “Hip hooray, he saved the day!”  They all cheered for Poquito, the one who had saved them from the evil cats.</p>
<p>The Mayor, Great Dane, came over and personally thanked him. “Is there something we could do for you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Poquito said.</p>
<p>“I know something.” said Husky, coming to stand next to Poquito. “I think we should make a statue of our hero and place it in the park for all to see!” Then he lifted Poquito into the air. “Three cheers for Blanket Dog!” </p>
<p>And the dogs did place a statue in the park of Blanket Dog, who saved the Mayor and the town of Houndville from the evil cats. You can still find that statue today in Houndville, of the little Blanket Dog, Poquito.</p>
