				<h1>The Boy</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Once upon a time, in a small cottage just outside of a small peaceful town, there lived a woman and her boy. The mother was quiet, gentle, and very loving, just like the other mothers in the small town. The boy, however, was mean, untidy, and never did what he was told. One day, a trading caravan passed through the town and one of the travelers saw the boy and watched him closely because he wore a mischievous look on his face. The boy picked up a rock and threw it at a horse that was pulling a wagon full of glass. The horse panicked and ran into a ditch, tipping the wagon over and breaking every single glass item into a million sparkling shards. The boy ran home laughing all the way, not noticing that the traveler was following.</p>
	<p>The traveler knocked on the cottage door and the boy answered with a gruff, “What do you want?” The traveler gently replied, “Is your mother home?” For an answer, he saw the timid woman peek her head around the door. “May I speak with you?” he asked. She nodded and bade him enter. He told her what the boy had done. She was very upset, saying there was no way to repay the damage. The traveler said, “My mistress has need of a servant just your boy’s age. If you will lend him to her, he can work off his debt and we can turn him into a man instead of the misbehaved boy he is now.” The woman saw no other way to pay for the damage, so she let the traveler take him.</p>
	<p>So the traveler took the boy and they traveled to the far north where the land whispered of enchantment and mist hung lightly over the tall evergreens like graceful ball gowns. The traveler led the boy down a small path that led to a nearly ruined castle. Standing in the doorway was a hideous old woman. The boy cringed when he saw her. “This,” said the traveler “is my mistress. You must obey her every wish for she is a witch and can turn you to stone with a flick of her wrist. Obey her, and your time here will go quickly. Or if you continue to behave as you have, you will be punished. I have my travels to continue, and you will stay here; no running away, for there is no place to run to up here. Farewell.”</p>
	<p>“Come here, boy.” the witch said in a craggy but strong voice. The boy had never been so afraid of someone in his life. “You have been a handful, I see.” She led him inside and told him his tasks. “If you work hard for me, you will pay off your debt quickly. If not, you will be here for a long time.” The boy didn’t want to be here long and was beginning to see the price he was paying for his bad deeds. “I won’t give you any trouble; I will do what you ask.” he said regrettably. </p>
	<p>So time went on and the boy worked hard at every task he was given, even when he felt like giving up, he kept going. He even began to not fear the witch, for she was never cruel to him. He continued to stay with the witch long after he had paid off his debts, for she was all alone. One day, nine years later, the boy, who was no longer a boy, was called to the witch. “You have worked hard and well, and now I have the hardest job yet for you.” </p>
	<p>“You have taught me more than I could ever have imagined. I can never repay you for that. I will do whatever you ask.” He said.</p>
	<p>“Years ago something was stolen from me by the Goblin Queen who lives in a palace of ice at the top of the world. You must get it back for me.” she pleaded.</p>
	<p>“I will journey to return that which was stolen from you. What is it that you seek?” he asked.</p>
	<p>“Alas, I cannot tell you, for if I did, you would have to serve the Goblin Queen till the world ends. If it is not returned to me by the year’s end… boy, I have only one year of life left in me. Will you bring back to me that thing which I treasure more than anything? Will you bring it to me? If you return it, you will not need to be my servant any longer. I will free you.”</p>
	<p>“I will do what you ask with haste so that we may spend what time you have left together. I owe you that much and more, for you have taught me the importance of kindness, integrity, and valor. For that, call me not your servant but loyal companion.”</p>
<p>“Then take these to help you on your journey.  This bag will always have food in it to sustain you. This sling and fire balls will protect you. This whistle will call my friend to you, but only use it in dire need.”</p>
<p>He bowed to her then gathered the things she gave him and left with a wave. As the old witch waved back she whispered, “So the boy becomes a man.”</p>
	<p>The boy, no the man, began his journey to the top of the world to seek that castle of ice to retrieve something, he had no idea what it could be, but still he chose to go. He traveled past the enchanted forest and as all the trees disappeared, he found himself in a barren land where there was more rock than growth. There was a sharp chill in the wind that let him know he was on the right track. </p>
	<p>For many days and weeks he traveled this barren land which had gradually turned into a world of snow and ice. He knew he was getting close.</p>
	<p>One cold morning he was awoken by a deep grumbling coming from under the snow. He decided that was a warning that he had better be on his way. The farther he went the louder the grumbling got till it seemed to shake the very air. Quite suddenly, it stopped. He looked around, preparing himself for the worst. The ground in front of him burst open and out came a pearly white snow dragon which spat ice crystals at the man. He dived away, the ice projectiles barely missing him. The witch had prepared him well for such an encounter; he reached into a pocket pulled out enchanted balls and a sling. He dodged the dragon’s second attack, loaded the sling, and flung the ball. It hit the dragon’s head and exploded into flames. The dragon screamed and landed writhing on the ground. </p>
	<p>The man knew this must be the guardian of the evil Goblin Queen. He was close. He climbed up a hill and looked around and saw six sharp towers of ice winking in the sunlight; the castle at the top of the world. Now he needed to find a way to locate the Goblin Queen and discover what she stole from the witch. He decided to try the front door.</p>
	<p>He cautiously ascended the ice steps and entered the castle. It was completely silent inside as if sound had ceased to exist. His footsteps seemed loud and alien as he looked around. He entered a grand hall lined with grotesque ice sculptures which looked almost alive except that they were completely transparent. He began opening doors and going into rooms where everything was made of ice, from the couches to the curtains. Littered about in every room there were small globes of every color imaginable, connected to thin chains. They looked like they could be necklaces and they were in every room he looked in. He had a feeling that he was getting close to finding what he came for. He opened another door and entered the grandest room yet. It was still and quiet like the rest of the castle. He was expecting there to be more guards or minions of the Goblin Queen, but there was no one. This room was different from the other rooms; he didn’t see any of the globe necklaces. His eyes scanned the room and caught just the slightest of movements on the bed. He walked cautiously over to it and looked down on the most beautiful woman ever. She looked unreal, perfect. He could have stood there gazing at her forever but his quest hung heavily on his mind. He shook his head as if to clear it; he remembered his propose. He looked down and hanging around her neck was a globe necklace. Unlike the others, this one was glowing and swirling with a thousand colors. Could this be what he was after? He slowly reached for the necklace and grabbed the globe, but the moment he touched it the woman’s eyes opened glassy and red. He ripped off the necklace and the perfect woman changed into the Goblin Queen! She roared ferociously and tried to grab him but he jumped to the side and plunged his dagger into the creature. </p>
	<p>He ran from the room and the ice sculptures had come to life and were chasing him. Parts of the castle began to crumble and fall all around them. The castle was falling apart now that the Goblin Queen was dead. The exit was blocked by a row of the grotesque ice monsters. A part of the castle crumbled to his left, revealing sunlight. He ran toward it and made it out into the light as the castle completely collapsed behind him. The ice monsters had also escaped and were starting to surround him. There was no escape. He remembered the whistle the witch had given him. His need was great so he blew it. A sharp trill broke through the grunts and growls of the ice monsters. Down from the sky came the mythical snow bird, whiter than the snow and one hundred times larger than any bird he had ever seen. The gusts from its wings blew the enemy down as it landed beside him.</p>
	<p>“Thank you, my friend.” He bowed to the bird, the bird bowed back. “You are welcome. You may ride on my back and I will take you back to the witch.” The man was a bit startled that it spoke. “The witch saved me as a hatchling, and I gave her that whistle to use whenever her need was great, to repay her kindness. Now up! Let us fly. Time is running out.” The man climbed up and the bird flew high into the sky.</p>
	<p>It seemed to take only a short while till he was once again in the green, living world and landing in the castle courtyard where the witch lived. He arrived with only three days to spare, three days until the year’s end.</p>
	<p>The witch slowly hobbled out to him and anxiously asked, “What have you brought home to me?”</p>
	<p>“What you seek, my lady.” He held out the shimmering globe necklace. “Come.” said the witch. She led him to the back garden and they came to a short stone pillar. She took the necklace and laid it on top of the stone, then bent down and picked up a mallet. She held it out to him and said, “Would you do the honors?” 
	<p>“What? You want me to destroy something so beautiful?” he asked.</p>
	<p>“Trust me, you will see in time.”</p>
	<p>“I trust you with my life.” He swung and shattered the globe. Colors burst from the broken globe, flying in all different directions. One hit the witch and light flashed, blinding him. He opened his eyes and before him, where the witch had been, stood a beautiful maiden. His heart flew up to his throat, “Who are you? Are you the witch?” </p>
	<p>“Yes and no. I am a sorceress who made the Goblin Queen jealous. I was beginning to become more powerful than her. She cursed me and I had to have a young man work for me for ten years and then willingly travel to the ice palace and retrieve my true self which she had locked away in that globe. You freed me. You freed everyone when the palace fell and smashed all the other globes. No more can the Goblin Queen steal anyone else’s true selves.” She fell to her knees. “I am indebted to you, hero.”</p>
	<p>He lifted her up, “I knew somehow, despite the curse, I knew. Your eyes were young; I saw you in them. Dear lady sorceress I would spend the rest of my life with you if only you ask.” </p>
	<p>“Yes my hero, you have saved me in more ways than one and now I have only one more thing to ask. Marry me?”</p>
	<p>“Yes, my lady.” He replied. They walked into the shining castle where the old one once was and they lived there discovering new magics and living happily ever after.</p>
