				<h1>The Dancers</h1>
				<br>
				<p>The first time I saw the dancers was just a happy chance. I was sitting on my balcony on a calm summer evening. My balcony overlooked a park. I heard some old music and looked around and saw a couple dancing on the old tennis court. As I watched, I discovered that they were an old couple and they were actually dancing, not just swaying to the time of the song; they danced! It was beautiful to watch them glide through a series of intricate steps. I was mesmerized. After a few songs they turned off the small cassette player and smiling at each other, hand in hand, they walked away. I sighed and thought; “Now that is what true love looks like.”</p>
	<p>Over the next few weeks I started to watch for them and it soon became a habit. They would come to the park at dusk and dance to a few songs then leave as it was getting dark. I loved to watch them. As the weeks passed and summer was drawing near a close, I began to see something change. They danced a little slower and a little shorter till they were dancing only two or three songs. When the leaves began to change colors and the air began to cool, they still came to the park at dusk but this time she was in a wheelchair. I watched as he set the cassette player on the bench by the tennis court. He lifted his frail wife up into his arms and held her close as they danced one song.</p>
	<p>They danced like that for two more weeks. On the next Saturday he came alone. My heart tightened in pain. “Oh no.” I said, and without thinking I made my way to the park and found him sitting alone on the bench. He held the cassette player in his hands and his whole demeanor was wilted. I walked up slowly till I was in front of him. “Hi,” I said uncertain of what to say. “I’m Mandy Green. Do you mind if I sit by you?” </p>
<p>He looked up with sad eyes and nodded his head. “I’m Ned Harris.”  </p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you. I have to confess that I have been watching you and your wife dance here for quite a while. It was beautiful. Do you mind…” I paused and bit my lip. “Do you mind if I ask where she is this evening?”</p>
	<p>He drew in a long slow breath, “My wife, Mariah. Her funeral was this morning, she went home.”</p>
	<p>“I am so sorry. I loved to watch you dance together. I don’t think I’ve ever seen two people more in love than the two of you.” I said.</p>
	<p>“I love her so much. But you know it wasn’t always that way.” He looked at me over the top of his glasses. “Being in love as much as my wife and I were is not something that just happens, it has to be earned. There was a time when I hated to be at home. I was ready to throw in the towel and so was she. We had a series of rough patch after rough patch. I was done. Then as I was contemplating a divorce, I started to make a list of why we should. Then for argument sake I made a list of why we shouldn’t.” To my amazement he pulled out an old tattered piece of paper. It was the list he made. “The more I thought about why we should stay together the more I remembered why I picked her in the first place. I decided our marriage was worth fighting for. It wasn’t easy to swallow my pride but I knew things had to change. One thing we changed was that we would go on a date, just the two of us, every week. I took her dancing because she loves to dance.” He got out a handkerchief and wiped the tears that had started to fall down his face.</p>
	<p>“I fell in love for real this time. I learned what love really is. After that, the rough patches really weren’t rough. We made it through everything life threw at us. She is my best friend.” He sobbed. “I miss her.” </p>
	<p>I wiped the tears from my face and tried to say something but I couldn’t. What could I say? I didn’t know what he was going through or what he had lost. I was just a twenty-five year old single woman. I had no clue what it was like to love like this.</p>
	<p>He got up, patted my shoulder. “Thank you for listening.” He walked slowly away. I sat still and watched him go.</p>
	<p>I went through the next week thinking about all I had learned from this sweet couple. How important it was to work at staying in love. The next Saturday came and I watched for the old man. Evening fell and he never came. I sat down at my computer and curiously began to search through this last week’s obituary. There I found him.</p>
<p>“Ned Harris, loving and devoted husband and father. Just five days after his wife’s death he joined her in the afterlife. So in love that he couldn’t bear to be parted, he passed peacefully in his sleep.” I stopped reading as I could no longer see the computer screen through my tears. I never really realized what these strangers meant to me until they were gone. I now had a glimpse of what true love is and I knew I would never for the rest of my life forget the dancers.</p>
