				<h1>A Strawberry Day</h1>
				<br>
	<p>It was early Saturday morning when Lucy got up and felt in the mood for strawberries. She quickly got ready and headed out of her apartment on the eighth floor. She walked down the bustling street and crossed over to the park that held a farmers market. Beautiful displays of flowers, fruits, vegetables, and crafts tickled her senses. Lucy walked with a skip in her step, every bit of her enjoying this beautiful morning. She arrived at the stall she was looking for and asked for two pounds of beautiful jewel red strawberries. She paid and thanked the stall owner and turned to go. She turned too abruptly and ran right into someone, dropping her strawberries in the process.</p>
	<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry!” she said as she bent down to retrieve the strawberries spilling out of their bag. She looked up and saw it was a man and he was down on his knees in a suit helping her pick up her strawberries. “I should be the one to apologize, I wasn’t paying attention where I was going.” he replied. He put the strawberries in the bag and looked up. Their eyes met. All sound stopped. They both rose to their feet slowly, neither of them blinking. The man recovered first. “I, um, hope your strawberries are alright.” He looked down at his watch. “I’m sorry I’m late, do you need me to get you some new ones?”</p>
	<p>“No,” Lucy said. “It’s fine, you go on.”</p>
	<p>“Okay, bye.” he said, flustered, and hurried through the crowd. Lucy’s eyes followed him and he turned back once and caught her staring. He smiled then continued, disappearing into the crowd. Lucy stood there for a minute lost in thought when she heard the stall owner say, “Well, if that wasn’t a meet-cute I don’t know what is.”</p>
	<p>Lucy turned to him, confused. “A what?”</p>
	<p>“It might be a little too old fashioned for you young’uns these days, but a meet-cute is when a future romantic couple meets for the first time.” he explained.</p>
	<p>“Romantic couple? In this city, I doubt we will meet again.” she scoffed.</p>
	<p>“Whatever you say, but I say fate had a hand in that.” he said while smiling and pointing in the direction the man went. Lucy looked that way again and almost let herself imagine the possibilities. She turned back to the stall owner again to deny that fate had anything to do with it, but he was busy with another customer and she shrugged and went back home.</p>
	<p>Later that day, Lucy was walking through the town and happened upon a new boutique store named The Strawberry Boutique. It looked so cute inside that she decided to have a look around. The store was full of strawberry themed items and she chose strawberry lip gloss. She had a quick chat with the new owner and felt they could easily become friends. She waved goodbye with her hand on the door and opened it right as someone was passing and promptly smacked them in the face. She gasped and closed the door. “Are you alright?” she asked a man in a suit. His hands were covering his face for a moment while he recovered from the door hitting him. “I’ll be alright in a minute.” Then he lowered his hands. Lucy gasped and covered her mouth. </p>
	<p>“Strawberry girl.” he said astonished. </p>
	<p>“Lucy.” she replied. “I can’t believe I hit you again. I am so sorry. Is your nose okay…?”</p>
	<p>“Declan’s my name. I should have known it was you the moment the door hit my face.” he joked. </p>
	<p>“Sheer coincidence, I assure you.” Lucy nervously twisted her bag. “Well if you’re alright, I had better be going before I accidently hit you again. Bye!” Lucy quickly went around him completely mortified that she hit him in the face.</p>
	<p>She heard him laugh, “Bye Lucy!” he yelled to her. She turned back and waved, chagrinned. He laughed again and she smiled more naturally, then turned and went on her way.</p>
	<p>At her apartment, Lucy was beginning to turn the lovely large strawberries into a pie. She gathered all the ingredients on her counter and popped open her sugar canister. A few sugar crumbs clung to the bottom. Definitely not enough, even if she made a pie small enough to feed a mouse. “Oh bother.” She took her apron off and grabbed her purse and keys. She stopped at her hall mirror and applied her new strawberry lip gloss and headed off to the corner market.</p>
	<p>The evening summer sun made the city hot and she was glad to go inside the air-conditioned store. She grabbed a hand basket and set off toward the baking aisle. She picked up a small bag of sugar and went toward the check out. She didn’t notice that the person in front of her had just spilled something on the floor. She walked through it and slipped. She began to fall backwards when a pair of arms caught her. “I was ready for you this time.” She heard a familiar voice. She looked up and couldn’t believe her eyes. “Declan!”</p>
	<p>Declan helped her stand upright and made sure she had her footing before he let her go. “Third time’s the charm, so I hear.”</p>
	<p>“Thanks for catching me. I promise I am not always this clumsy.” She looked at him and noticed he was wearing casual clothes instead of his suit. Then she looked over in his basket. “Strawberry ice cream?” </p>
	<p>He nodded, “I was in the mood for strawberries.”</p>
	<p>Lucy smiled, “I just happen to be on my way back home to finish making a strawberry pie. Would you like to come over and have some?”
	<p>He held up his basket, smiling. “I bet it would go good with strawberry ice cream.”</p>
	<p>They both checked out and Lucy led the way back to her apartment. They talked the whole way there, getting to know each other. Up in her apartment, she made the crust while he sliced the strawberries. She finished putting the rest of the ingredients together and then put the pie in the oven. “I don’t think I’ve had a cooked strawberry pie before.” Declan commented.</p>
<p>“Most people haven’t, but it’s really good, I promise.” Lucy sat down at her table and Declan joined her.</p>
<p>“Just like you promised it was an accident when you hit me with the door.” he teased.</p>
	<p>“It was.” Lucy insisted. “I’m glad that we met again, though.”</p>
	<p>“If I had it my way, I would have rather spent the whole day with you after our first encounter. I had a meeting I was late for, though.”</p>
	<p>“The stall owner was saying something silly like it was fate.” Lucy said, blushing.</p>
	<p>“That’s exactly what I thought when you fell into my arms at the grocery store. Running into you three times in one day? It had to be fate.”</p>
	<p>“Hmm. Maybe it was.”</p>
	<p>Soon the timer on the oven went off and Lucy served the piping hot pie onto plates and Declan put a scoop of strawberry ice cream on top. Back at the table Lucy waited for Declan to take a bite first. “Wow, that tastes amazing.” He complemented. Lucy took a bite and let the strawberry flavor dance over her tongue. “Yes, it turned out beautifully.” she said. 
	<p>“Almost as beautiful as you.” Declan said.</p>
	<p>Lucy blushed and smiled. “Or as handsome as you.”</p>
	<p>They both took another bite of the sweet strawberry pie and pronounced it the perfect end to a strawberry day.</p>
