				<h1>The Thankful Tree</h1>
				<br>
				<p>“No, no, no, no!” he yelled as he pulled his sputtering car to the side of the road where it promptly died. He turned the key but the car didn’t respond. He gripped the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles shone white. Letting out a growl he got out of his dead car and slammed the door. He went around the front and opened the hood. The car was only eight years old but his commute to and from work had put a lot of miles on it. The strain finally proved too much. He could see nothing wrong under the hood and slammed it shut for good measure. He got in and tried again to start it but the result hadn’t changed. He got out and looked at where he was. He found himself next to the city park. He kicked the tire and shoved his hands into his pockets where he felt his cell phone. He didn’t call a tow truck, though. He couldn’t afford that now. Nor did he phone his wife. He had enough bad news already.</p>
	<p>He was coming home early, not for the Thanksgiving holiday, but because he had just been fired. The car problem just added to the mess. He didn’t want to tell his wife either; their marriage was having enough problems right now. He didn’t feel like going home. With his hands in his pockets he walked into the park. Autumn was drawing to a close and there were hardly any leaves left on the trees, but the sun was shining and it was quite warm.</p>
	<p>He walked the path, not caring where it took him and thought about the unfairness of his life. Fired from a job he worked so hard at, the car breaking down, marriage struggles, and his mom had passed away from cancer the previous month. He sat on a bench and looked up toward the heavens, “I have enough trials right now. Why did my car have to break on top of everything else, God?”</p>
	<p>Laughter pulled him out of his reverie and he looked across the path and saw a family adding some colorful papers to a tree that was already heavy with bits of paper hanging from it. It was an ugly gnarled tree and he remembered that it was dubbed The Thankful Tree. No one knows who started the tradition; it had been around for years now. People would come to this tree and tie bits of paper and other colorful things to the tree. He had forgotten it was here. He watched the family and wondered how many years it had been since he had brought his family here.</p>
	<p>He was not thankful right now, though. He was incredibly angry and discouraged with every part of his life. He sat there scowling at the tree adorned with all the things people had to be thankful for and the sight just made him sick. He got up and got ready to walk past the tree when he noticed that a plaque had been placed next to the tree. He wasn’t going to read it but the words seemed to jump out at him and grab his attention.</p>
<br><p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">To the dear soul who wanders past</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Won’t you stop and take a glance?</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">My leaves are gone, I’m all alone</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">There is no one to call my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">I’m old and far from what’s called pretty</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">But I know I don’t need pity.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">The ground is rich and warm and deep</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">My branches strong and they will keep.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">I have weathered many storms</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">And here I stand to tell the norms</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">I know that life is hard to bare</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">But here am I to say you ere</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">If you think your lot unfair</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Stop and think of what you’ve given</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">And you’ll see you’ve been forgiven</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Being thankful isn’t tough</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Just stop and write, you are enough</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Don’t give up on your fight</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Inside of you there is a light</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Write a thankful note and then</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Tie the note to gnarled limb</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">Take a step back and you will see</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">All the thank you's on this tree</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">And remember soul who wanders past</p>
<p style="text-align:center; text-indent:0">That hard times don’t always last.</p>
	<br><p>He looked up again at the tree and thought that this small poem could have been written just for him. Thoughtfully he watched the family as they finished tying their papers to the tree. The wife was holding a squirming toddler and he was attempting to grab the paper she gave to her husband to tie to the tree. The toddler fussed and grabbed her hat off revealing a head with no hair. She laughed and picked up the hat and put it back on. The husband finished hanging the last one and they moved off toward the play set. Curious, he went over to their notes and read the one the wife had. “I am thankful I was diagnosed with cancer.”</p>
	<p>Shocked, he scoffed, “Who would be thankful for that? My mom just died from cancer.” He flipped the card over and saw that more was written. “Now I know how strong I am and I know not to take a single moment for granted.”</p>
	<p>He felt some of his anger ebb away as he read her card and he felt he should read more of them. “I am thankful for my trials. Without them I would not be who I am today.” “I am thankful for electricity.” “I am thankful for soft fur on kittens.” “I am thankful for the air I breathe, and the fresh water I drink.” “I am thankful my dad takes me for bike rides.” “I am thankful for my Savior.” “I am thankful for life after death.” “I am thankful for chocolate.” On and on he read. They made him laugh and others made him cry. He felt a warm feeling spread in his chest as he read them and he knew what he needed to do.</p>
	<p>He walked purposefully to his car and when he went to his door, he found an envelope taped to the glass. He opened it and pulled out a folded piece of paper. Inside were five hundred dollars and a small note, “I noticed your car broke down. Someone helped me once, now it’s my turn. Hope this helps.” He looked up and around quickly to see if anyone was nearby. He saw no one. He looked at the note again in disbelief. His eyes fogged and years of pent up pain released in the form of tears. He sank to the ground and wept.</p>
	<p>Some time later he was able to call a tow truck and he got home. He ran inside and grabbed his wife and twirled her around like he did when they were dating. “What has gotten in to you?” she questioned, with a blush and a smile on her face. “Sweetie, I lost my job. My car broke down on the way home. But I just wanted to tell you I love you and I am so thankful that you are my wife.”</p>
	<p>She started to cry. “What’s wrong?” he asked.</p>
	<p>“Do you realize it has been months since you’ve told me that?”</p>
	<p>“Things are going to be different from now on. Come, I need to take you and the kids somewhere.” he said.</p>
	<p>He, his wife, and their three kids piled into the family van and went to the park. He brought them to The Thankful Tree. By the tree was a box with paper, string, and pens. He took one out and said aloud as he wrote, “I am thankful I was fired from my job. Now I get to spend time with my family.” His kids looked at him like he was crazy. “I am thankful my car broke down at this park so I could be reminded of all the good things in my life. And that there are good people out there to help those in need.” Then he told them about the stranger who had left money on the car window. “I am thankful that God gave me a second chance with my family.” He looked up, “Will you forgive me for being gone all the time at my job?” he asked his children. They looked at him with caution and he could see it would take time to heal the rift between them but he knew now he needed to not take any moment for granted. “I am thankful God lead me here. I needed to be reminded that happiness is a grateful heart.” He hung up his note and then his kids ran and got paper of their own and so did his wife. Soon they were laughing and having fun again after what felt like the first time in forever.</p>
	<p>As they walked happily back to the car, he looked up once again and whispered, “Thank you.”</p>
