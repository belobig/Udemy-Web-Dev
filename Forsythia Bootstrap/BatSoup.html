				<h1>Bat Soup</h1>
				<br>
				<p><img src="images/Fredthebat_small.jpg" style="padding:20px" /></p>
				<p>“Oh, dear. Oh, dear.” said Ms. Poppy Cauldron as she looked down at the thermometer. “One hundred and one. Of all the days to get sick it had to happen on Halloween.” She hung up her tall black witch's hat and set her broom against the wall. “I guess I won’t be able to be in the witch’s parade this year. I am going to bed to rest my head.” But her pet bat Fred was just getting to work.</p>
	<p>“If Ms. Poppy is sick, this calls for a batch of my special bat soup!” Fred flew to the kitchen and opened the fridge. “Empty! Well I can’t make bat soup without any ingredients. Off to the store I go!” He flew through the open window out into the dusky night sky. He flew straight to Gargoyle’s Grocer. He flew to the entrance and saw a sign. He hung upside down from the rafters and read, “Store closed for Halloween.”</p>
	<p>“Oh, no, now what should I do?” Fred looked around and saw his friend Mr. Fox going to the Halloween parade. He flew after him and said, “Hey Mr. Fox, Ms. Poppy is sick and I want to make her some soup but the store is closed. Do you have anything to spare for soup?”</p>
	<p>“Of course.” said Mr. Fox and he gave Fred his small pumpkin. “I was taking this to the Carving contest but you need it more than me. I already cleaned it out, so it’s ready to use.”</p>
	<p>“That’s perfect, thank you so much!” Fred gripped around the pumpkin and flew off in search of more ingredients.</p>
	<p>After flying down the street he passed the vampires house and saw their son Vampy carrying something while plugging his nose. “What are you doing?” asked Fred.</p>
	<p>With his nose still plugged Vampy said in a muffled voice, “Someone left garlic on our porch for a prank this year, again. Mom is making me take it to the trash.”</p>
	<p>“Could I have it?” Fred asked.</p>
	<p>“Why would you want it? It’s gross.” Vampy grimaced at the garlic.</p>
	<p>“I’m making soup for Ms. Poppy. She is sick.”</p>
	<p>“Be my guest.” Vampy said.</p>
	<p>Fred set down the pumpkin and opened the top. Vampy dropped the garlic into the empty pumpkin and wiped his hands on his black cape. “Are you going to the parade? It’s going to start soon.”</p>
	<p>“No, I am going to take care of Ms. Poppy.” He put the top back on and started to fly away.</p>
	<p>“Good luck!” said Vampy as he flew away.</p>
	<p>Fred tried to think of what else he needed. He flew around and saw a tall, milky-white ghost floating down the street. He flew over to the ghost and asked, “Do you have something I could add to my soup?”</p>
	<p>The ghost gave a gloomy moan and pointed into the trees. “Over there?” asked Fred. The ghost nodded and floated away.</p>
	<p>Fred flew into the trees and he began to smell something, something delicious! He saw a bright fire burning through the trees and found a group of ghouls roasting meat and onions over the fire. ‘That would be perfect to add to my soup,’ thought Fred.</p>
 	<p>He flew over to the ghouls and asked, “Please could you spare some of your meat and onions for the soup I am making for Ms. Poppy?”</p>
	<p>“Certainly,” grinned the ghouls and they loaded up the pumpkin with steaming meat and onions. “If you want some more things, the Jackalope who lives on the other side of the hill has huge garden full of vegetables.”</p>
	<p>“Thank you!” said Fred and he flew over the hill to see if the Jackalope was home. He saw small hole in the side of the hill that had a door with a big knocker on it. He carefully set down the pumpkin and used the big knocker to pound once on the door.</p>
	<p>“Who is it?” came a cranky voice on the other side of the door.</p>
	<p>“It’s Fred the bat.” he replied.</p>
	<p>“Well go away, I am in no mood for visitors.” The voice griped.</p>
	<p>“Please, I need some vegetables for my soup. Ms. Poppy is sick and the store is closed. Couldn’t you spare some of yours?” he pleaded.</p>
	<p>“Hmm. What’s that you say? Ms. Poppy is sick.” The Jackalope opened the door. He was very elderly and used a cane to walk. “Ms. Poppy always makes me a potion for my rheumatism. If she needs some of my vegetables she is welcome to them.” He pointed at his lush garden with his knobby cane. “Help yourself.” Then he slammed the door in Fred’s face.</p>
 	<p>“Thank you.” Fred called through the door and chuckled at the old Jackalope's manners. He flew into the garden and pulled up a few carrots and some celery and he flew over to the herbs and picked some parsley. He put everything in the pumpkin which was now full and very heavy. He beat his wings as hard as he could and he lifted the pumpkin back into the air and headed back home. He nearly dropped the pumpkin on several occasions but at last he was able to fly in the open window and set the pumpkin on the kitchen table.</p>
	<p>Now the real work began. Fred took out all of the ingredients and washed, and sliced, and chopped. He started the fire with a large caldron hanging over it and began to add the ingredients. “What are you doing in there, Fred?” Came Ms. Poppy’s voice. “It’s a surprise.” said Fred. “You just stay in your room and rest. I’ll bring it in when I’m done.”</p>
	<p>He finished adding all the ingredients and soon the soup in the cauldron was bubbling and was a lovely orange color. Fred scooped some of the hot soup into a bowl and flew it into Ms. Poppy’s room.</p>
	<p>“Is that for me?” Ms. Poppy asked. “Achoo!” Several dust bunnies scurried out from under the bed and shivered in the corner.</p>
	<p>“You don’t sound too good. Here, I made you my special bat soup.” Fred flew the soup over and Poppy grabbed it. </p>
	<p>“Thank you, Fred. You are the best friend a witch ever had!” She slurped the soup and Fred hung from the ceiling.</p>
	<p>Just as Fred was getting comfortable he heard a knock at the door. He flew to it and opened to find his friend Mr. Fox. “What are you doing here? I thought you were going to the parade?”</p>
	<p>Mr. Fox was hopping excitedly. “Go open Ms. Poppy’s window, hurry!” and he bounced away. Confused, Fred did as he was asked. He flew to the window by Ms. Poppy’s bed and pulled the curtains open. His mouth fell open. “Look, Ms. Poppy, they moved the parade to come by your house.” Fred grabbed the window latch and opened the window, dislodging several spiders.</p>
	<p>Several witches on broom sticks zoomed past the window cackling “Get well soon!” And the whole of the Halloween parade was passing the house. </p>
	<p>“Because you couldn’t make it to the parade, they brought the parade to you!” exclaimed Fred. </p>
	<p>Poppy leaned on the windowsill and watched the parade go by as she ate her pumpkin soup. “You know, I think this has been the best Halloween.” She patted Fred on the head.</p>
	<p>Fred looked at the smile on Ms. Poppy’s face and he had to agree, it was the best Halloween.</p>
