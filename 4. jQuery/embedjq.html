		Or, to use the latest version of jQuery,
		you can change src to "http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"
		This may also be a faster method if the user has already been to a site that uses this version.
		Using a locally stored version makes it so the user's browser has to download your copy of jquery when they visit your site,
		but this way you can ensure they use a specific version. -->
